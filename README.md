# Blockchain_Python

This program implements python to work with hierarchical deterministic wallet. It builds interfaces with various crypto currencies (Bitcoin, Bitcoin-test and Ethereum) and transacts using the wallet.

To be able to run the program, make sure the folowing conditions are met:
- PHP version 7 is installed. Note: PHP Version 8 has issues working with HD Wallet Derive
- HD Wallet Derive is installed and running (reference: (https://github.com/dan-da/hd-wallet-derive))
- Python "bit" library is installed
- Python web3.py is installed

### Project setup

- Create a project directory called `wallet` and `cd` into it.

- Clone the `hd-wallet-derive` tool into this folder and install.

- Create a symlink called `derive` for the `hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php` script into the top level project using the command : `ln -s hd-wallet-derive/hd-wallet-derive.php derive`

- Test that you can run the `./derive` script properly, use one of the examples on the repo's `README.md`

- Create a file called `wallet.py` -- this will be your universal wallet script.

### Setup constants

- In a separate file, `constants.py`, set the following constants:
  - `BTC = 'btc'`
  - `ETH = 'eth'`
  - `BTCTEST = 'btc-test'`

- In `wallet.py`, import all constants: `from constants import *`

- Use these anytime you reference these strings, both in function calls, and in setting object keys.

### Generate a Mnemonic

- Generate a new 12 word mnemonic

- Set this mnemonic as an environment variable, and include the one you generated as a fallback using:
  `mnemonic = os.getenv('MNEMONIC')`

  ### Deriving the wallet keys

- Use the `subprocess` library to call the `./derive` script from Python. Make sure to properly wait for the process.

- The following flags must be passed into the shell command as variables:
  - Mnemonic (`--mnemonic`) must be set from an environment variable, or default to a test mnemonic
  - Coin (`--coin`)
  - Numderive (`--numderive`) to set number of child keys generated

- Set the `--format=json` flag, then parse the output into a JSON object using `json.loads(output)`

- You should wrap all of this into one function, called `derive_wallets`

- Create an object called `coins` that derives `ETH` and `BTCTEST` wallets with this function.
  When done properly, the final object should look something like this (there are only 3 children each in this image):

  ### Linking the transaction signing libraries

Now, we need to use `bit` and `web3.py` to leverage the keys we've got in the `coins` object.
You will need to create three more functions:

- `priv_key_to_account` -- this will convert the `privkey` string in a child key to an account object
  that `bit` or `web3.py` can use to transact.
  This function needs the following parameters:

  - `coin` -- the coin type (defined in `constants.py`).
  - `priv_key` -- the `privkey` string will be passed through here.

  You will need to check the coin, then return one of the following functions based on the library:

  - For `ETH`, return `Account.privateKeyToAccount(priv_key)`
      - This function returns an account object from the private key string. You can read more about this object [here](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.0/web3-eth-accounts.html#privatekeytoaccount).
  - For `BTCTEST`, return `PrivateKeyTestnet(priv_key)`
      - This is a function from the `bit` libarary that converts the private key string into a WIF (Wallet Import Format) object. WIF is a special format bitcoin uses to designate the types of keys it generates. 
      - You can read more about this function [here](https://ofek.dev/bit/dev/api.html).

- `create_tx` -- this will create the raw, unsigned transaction that contains all metadata needed to transact.
  This function needs the following parameters:

  - `coin` -- the coin type (defined in `constants.py`).
  - `account` -- the account object from `priv_key_to_account`.
  - `to` -- the recipient address.
  - `amount` -- the amount of the coin to send.

  You will need to check the coin, then return one of the following functions based on the library:

  - For `ETH`, return an object containing `to`, `from`, `value`, `gas`, `gasPrice`, `nonce`, and `chainID`.
    Make sure to calculate all of these values properly using `web3.py`!
  - For `BTCTEST`, return `PrivateKeyTestnet.prepare_transaction(account.address, [(to, amount, BTC)])`

- `send_tx` -- this will call `create_tx`, sign the transaction, then send it to the designated network.
  This function needs the following parameters:

  - `coin` -- the coin type (defined in `constants.py`).
  - `account` -- the account object from `priv_key_to_account`.
  - `to` -- the recipient address.
  - `amount` -- the amount of the coin to send.

  You may notice these are the exact same parameters as `create_tx`. `send_tx` will call `create_tx`, so it needs
  all of this information available.

  You will need to check the coin, then create a `raw_tx` object by calling `create_tx`. Then, you will need to sign
  the `raw_tx` using `bit` or `web3.py` (hint: the account objects have a sign transaction function within).

  Once you've signed the transaction, you will need to send it to the designated blockchain network.

  - For `ETH`, return `w3.eth.sendRawTransaction(signed.rawTransaction)`
  - For `BTCTEST`, return `NetworkAPI.broadcast_tx_testnet(signed)`

  ### Send some transactions!

Now, you should be able to fund these wallets using testnet faucets. Open up a new terminal window inside of `wallet`,
then run `python`. Within the Python shell, run `from wallet import *` -- you can now access the functions interactively.
You'll need to set the account with  `priv_key_to_account` and use `send_tx` to send transactions.

#### Bitcoin Testnet transaction

- Fund a `BTCTEST` address using [this testnet faucet](https://testnet-faucet.mempool.co/).

- Use a [block explorer](https://tbtc.bitaps.com/) to watch transactions on the address.

- Send a transaction to another testnet address (either one of your own, or the faucet's).

- Screenshot the confirmation of the transaction like so:

#### Local PoA Ethereum transaction

- Add one of the `ETH` addresses to the pre-allocated accounts in your `networkname.json`.

- Delete the `geth` folder in each node, then re-initialize using `geth --datadir nodeX init networkname.json`.
  This will create a new chain, and will pre-fund the new account.

- [Add the following middleware](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/middleware.html#geth-style-proof-of-authority) to `web3.py` to support the PoA algorithm:

from web3.middleware import geth_poa_middleware

w3.middleware_onion.inject(geth_poa_middleware, layer=0)

- Due to a bug in `web3.py`, you will need to send a transaction or two with MyCrypto first, since the
  `w3.eth.generateGasPrice()` function does not work with an empty chain. You can use one of the `ETH` address `privkey`,
  or one of the `node` keystore files.

- Send a transaction from the pre-funded address within the wallet to another, then copy the `txid` into
  MyCrypto's TX Status, and screenshot the successful transaction like so:
